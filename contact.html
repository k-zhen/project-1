            <p class="about-desc">Created by the Japanese toy manufacturer, Toru Soeya, Sonny Angels are cherub figurines that come in a variety of headgear and outfits. They were designed to be a tiny companion for working women in their mid-20s to help them navigate through the stresses of adulthood.</p>
            <p class="about-desc">Over the summer, I was introduced to them and began a small collection of my own. Currently, I own 17 figurines from multiple series of collections. Since they come in blind boxes, they are also the reason I have developed a minor gambling addiction which is something my wallet is not happy about.</p>
